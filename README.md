Dotfiler: Emacs configs
=======================

This repository contains my emacs configs, based on Emacs Starter Kit.
It's purpose to be used as a repository for [dotfiler][].

For convinience, don't copy these files into you homedir. Instead,
go and install [dotfiler][], then clone this repository, using
`dot add <url>` command and run `dot update` to make all necessary
symlinks.
